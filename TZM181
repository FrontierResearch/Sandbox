    "There were 5 different species of seagrass identified in our surveys; *Cymodecea serrulata* (CS), *Enhalus acoroides* (EA), *Syringodium isoetofolium* (SI), *Thassalia hempricii* (TH), and *Halodule uninervis* (HI).  Either *C. serrulata* or *E. acoroides* were the primarily dominant species in 28 out of the 39 transects.  Unique fish species per transect ranged from 1 to 18, with at least 1 species of fish observed in each survey.  Seagrass coverage and the related fish abundance and fish species diversity are plotted in Figure 1. The highest values for both fish abundance (205 individuals) and fish diversity (18 species) were found in Transect 14, which was dominated by *S. isoetofolium.*"
